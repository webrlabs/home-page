### From Zero to Hero: A Journey with Jules

When I decided to create a personal website to showcase my projects, I knew I wanted to try something different. As a Mechanical Engineer, my web development skills are not as sharp as I'd like. That's when I turned to Jules, an AI software engineer from Google.

The process was fascinating. I started with a basic template repository and a set of requirements. I wanted a modern, glassmorphic design with a red color scheme, a blog-style project list, and the ability to host my web-based projects.

Jules took these requirements and ran with them. It started by exploring the codebase, understanding the existing Flask and React setup. Then, it formulated a detailed plan, which it presented to me for approval. Once I gave the green light, Jules got to work.

#### The Nitty-Gritty

Jules handled everything from setting up the development environment, installing dependencies, and creating new components, to styling the website and setting up the routing. It was like having a senior developer on my team, guiding me through the process.

This website is a testament to the power of AI in software development. It's not just about writing code; it's about understanding requirements, planning, and executing. I'm excited to see what else I can build with Jules in the future.
